                   ELSE 'Senior Sales'
               END
           WHEN Department = 'Engineering' THEN
               CASE
                   WHEN Salary < 60000 THEN 'Junior Engineer'
                   ELSE 'Senior Engineer'
               END
           ELSE 'Other'
       END AS JobCategory
FROM Employees;

5)NULL values in a CASE statement?
=>
SELECT EmployeeID,
       Department,
       CASE
           WHEN Department IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'
           ELSE Department
       END AS DepartmentStatus
FROM Employees;

6)Use a CASE to generate a column that shows 'Early', 'On Time', or 'Late' based on the ArrivalTime column. Assume 'On Time' is between 9 AM and 9:15 AM?
=>

SELECT EmployeeID,
       ArrivalTime,
       CASE
           WHEN ArrivalTime < '09:00:00' THEN 'Early'
           WHEN ArrivalTime BETWEEN '09:00:00' AND '09:15:00' THEN 'On Time'
           ELSE 'Late'
       END AS ArrivalStatus
FROM Attendance;

7)Use a CASE statement can be used with aggregate functions?
=>
SELECT Department,
       SUM(CASE
               WHEN Salary < 30000 THEN Salary
               ELSE 0
           END) AS LowSalaries,
       SUM(CASE
               WHEN Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 60000 THEN Salary
               ELSE 0
           END) AS MediumSalaries,
       SUM(CASE
               WHEN Salary > 60000 THEN Salary
               ELSE 0
           END) AS HighSalaries
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
