1)categorize employees based on their salary into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' categories?
=>
SELECT EmployeeID,
       Salary,
       CASE
           WHEN Salary < 30000 THEN 'Low'
           WHEN Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 60000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'High'
       END AS SalaryCategory
FROM Employees;


2)Use a CASE statement within an UPDATE statement to update a column based on conditions?
=>
UPDATE Employees
SET SalaryCategory = CASE
                        WHEN Salary < 30000 THEN 'Low'
                        WHEN Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 60000 THEN 'Medium'
                        ELSE 'High'
                     END;


3)Use a CASE statement to calculate a 10% bonus for employees with a performance rating of 'A', 5% for 'B', and no bonus for others.
=>
SELECT EmployeeID,
       Salary,
       PerformanceRating,
       Salary * CASE
                   WHEN PerformanceRating = 'A' THEN 0.10
                   WHEN PerformanceRating = 'B' THEN 0.05
                   ELSE 0
                END AS Bonus
FROM Employees;
